            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Happy Happy Joy Joy, Amsterdam, Netherlands</h1><p>Things just got a little spicier in the thriving Amsterdam enclave of Old West. Chef Julius Jaspers has teamed up with design studio Concrete to create a bold and brash Asian street food joint dubbed Happy Happy Joy Joy, and it's as loose and playful as its name implies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60a826db0cfed461ded0078091f5410155392471.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light's L16 Pocket-Sized Multi-Aperture Camera</h1><p>No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side featuring a whopping 16 lenses. This visual assessment immediately reveals just how advanced the technology is within the device. When capturing an image, all lenses fire at different focal lengths and a computational software within the camera assembles them to maximize every pixel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a15091274eec7069ecc73315c0d0bf176c8c5ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wild Shape-Shifting Sofa Can Be Whatever You Want It to Be</h1><p>Carlo Ratti, who founded MIT's forward-thinking Senseable City Lab, has designed a sofa called Lift-Bit. It is on display at La Triennale in Milan, where innumerable furniture-makers showcase their work in an annual design fair. Sofas (and chairs, for that matter) at Salone del Mobile are like fish in an aquarium: plentiful and beautiful, but, after a while, hard to discern.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/878c309bc4bb2576485cf628acdf5521363f1166.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd35d86c6f1815ff301b89ff31df46ba5d96e829.jpg"></article>]]></description>
